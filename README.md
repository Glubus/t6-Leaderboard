# t6-Leaderboard
A fresh t6 leaderboard in gsc (not mean to be really used because iw4madmin exist so its kinda pointless)

# How to use

1- Install mysql

2- Create a server

3- Create a mysql database named player

4- Modify leaderboard.gsc with your mysql log data (host, password, port, etc ...)

5- Start your server

6- Check if no error (do a ticket if error)

7- Add bot 

8- Still no error ? mean it finished and everything is good

# Plan to add

1- Rating not only on kill (on assist, win or badges like nuclear)

2- Stats hud (command in chat !stats that show a hud with stats on server)

3- Website templates
